# TradingTips

Using historical data to train an AI model to trade cryptocurrencies using these data inputs:

Raw (x,y) minute data
Interpolated spline function representing the data
A Python matplotlib .png image of the chart

The goal is to get the AI model to an 80% successful trade rate, and then optimize it from there to hopefully be above 90% accuracy trading.

Once trained, there will be a Flutter app called TradingTips that will interact with the trained model via an API, showing AI generated trades to the user.

The app will be $10 / month.
