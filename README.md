# Chart Buddy

Using historical data to train an AI model to trade cryptocurrencies using these data inputs:

Raw (x,y) minute data

Interpolated spline function representing the data

A Python matplotlib .png image of the chart

The goal is to get the AI model to an 80% successful trade rate, and then optimize it from there to hopefully be above 90% accuracy trading.

Once trained, there will be a Flutter app that will interact with the trained model via an API, showing what trade the AI model would make.

Choose from micro, day, or swing trade for length of trade.

Watch tokens for free, or pay for AI engine credits to query specific charts in real time.

Not financial advice. Just an API to display what the trading bot would do, and the percentages it comes up with for likelihood of a good trade.
